## Heading ##
Announcing PhotoDrop, a social location-based photo exploration iOS application.

## Sub-Heading ##
PhotoDrop allows iOS users to find and share photos with friends and groups based on their current geolocation.

## Summary ##
PhotoDrop offers two main functions: PhotoShare and PhotoExplore. With PhotoShare, users can take photos with the app and store them at their current location for other users to see. With PhotoExplore, users can see the photos dropped near their current location, and photos can be filtered by friends and groups.

## Problem ##
Existing photo sharing apps don't connect users based on geolocation.

## Solution ##
PhotoDrop adds an extra layer to photo sharing, making it fun for people share photos of places they've been and to connect with their friends as they explore the world.
